# Extract Text From PDF

A simple React + TypeScript + Vite application demonstrating how to extract text from PDF files directly in the browser using pdfjs-dist.
I just want to test the package "pdfjs-dist" in test production environment before using the package for real production code.

### TL;DR
Due to differences between Viteâ€™s bundling mechanism and Next.jsâ€™s, this example does not fully address my production problems ðŸ˜† 
Still I maanage to fix the next js pdfjs-dist problem. But yeah, you have a fully working text extraction in vite using pdfjs-dist. 

## Features

- Upload a PDF file via a file input
- Read the file as an ArrayBuffer
- Extract text content from all pages using `pdfjs-dist`
- Display extracted text in a scrollable area

## Project Structure

- `src/util/extract.ts` â€” Utility functions: `readFileAsArrayBuffer` and `extractTextFromPdf`
- `src/App.tsx` â€” Main React component for file upload and text display
- `public/` â€” Static assets
- `vite.config.ts` â€” Vite configuration with React support
